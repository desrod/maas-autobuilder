# MAAS Auto-builder

This is a quick-and-dirty set of shell scripts that will build out and
bootstrap a MAAS environment with all of the bits and pieces you need to get
it running for any cloud, any workload.

manage-maas-nodes...: Create kvm instances that MAAS will manage
bootstrap--maas.sh..: Build and bootstrap your MAAS environment

There are plenty of options to customize its behavior, as well as drop in to
any step of the process without rebuilding the full MAAS from scratch.


## Requirements

Requires, minimally, 'bash', 'jq' and a working Ubuntu environment.  This
has **not** been tested on CentOS or Debian, but should work minimally on
those environments, if you choose to make that your host.  Patches are
welcome, of course.


## Components

```
  -a <cloud_name>    Do EVERYTHING (maas, juju cloud, juju bootstrap)
  -b                 Build out and bootstrap a new MAAS
  -c <cloud_name>    Add a new cloud + credentials
  -i                 Just install the dependencies and exit
  -j <name>          Bootstrap the Juju controller called <name>
  -n                 Create MAAS kvm nodes (to be imported into chassis)
  -r                 Remove the entire MAAS server + dependencies
  -t <cloud_name>    Tear down the cloud named <cloud_name>
```

## Installing and testing MAAS 

Just run './bootstrap-maas.sh' with the appropriate option above. 
Minimally, you'll want to use './bootstra-maas.sh -b' or '-i' to install
just the components needed.

I've done all the work needed to make this as idempotent as possible.  It
will need some minor tweaks to get working with MAAS 2.4.x, becauase of the
newer PostgreSQL dependencies.

MAAS from snap is also not supported (yet) again for the same SQL
dependencies which are included inside the MAAS snap.


## TODO and What's Next

* Support for using MAAS from snap vs.  main or PPA.  With snap, postgresql
  and other deps are installed in the snap, so handling has to change
